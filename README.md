Wordle clone I built from scratch with React and Vite, to practice React development.

Give it a whirl:

## https://wordle-ten-sable.vercel.app/

# Features:
- Standard [Wordle rules](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
- Unlike the original Wordle, you aren't restricted to one game per day.
- Multiple language support (currently: English, Turkish, Finnish and Spanish).
- An optional *time mode*, where you get 30 seconds per word. If you don't enter e valid word in 30 seconds, a random word is generated and submitted for you, using only the letters that aren't ruled out by your previous guesses.
- Display stats after the game ends, where upon you can also share the game result.
